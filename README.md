## Greetings Everyone!

I love developing secure and privacy oriented applications using primarily Go, Python, and Rust.

Occasioanlly I like to do a few data science projects using R and Python.

I maintain a very broad skillset, and just jump around multiple different projects to keep me engaged and continuing to improve my workflow day by day.
