## Greetings Everyone!

Founder of the **to be** best hosting company [Voltaic Hosting](https://www.voltaic.host) 

I am new to the open-source community, looking to maintain and improve my skills so criticism is very welcome.

**I will keep it simple:**

- I am big on Privacy and Security, and no not to the extreme-end lol.
- Former US Army Infantryman and Pilot.
- I am from South Africa and moved to the United States when I was 12 years old.
- I prefer to use **Rust, Go, and Typescript** but I also like mixing it up a bit.
- Occasionally I like to do a few data projects using R and Python.

**Some background on my hosting experience:**

I started hosting servers when I was 14 (8 years ago) for friends and family. Shortly after I hosted servers for communities. Now I want to bring a better platform to everyone.
